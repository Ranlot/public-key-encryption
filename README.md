Some notes inspired by the Coursera class [Number Theory and Cryptography](https://www.coursera.org/learn/number-theory-cryptography/home/welcome).

- [One-Time-Pad.ipynb](https://github.com/Ranlot/public-key-encryption/blob/master/One-Time-Pad.ipynb)  
Jupyter notebook with an emphasis on concepts such as perfect secrecy, information leakage with key re-use and an attack based on malleability.

- [RSA.ipynb](https://github.com/Ranlot/public-key-encryption/blob/master/RSA.ipynb)  
Jupyter notebook implementing RSA encryption/decryption from scratch with a real SSH key generated *ssh-keygen*.

- ["Public key encryption for pedestrians: RSA + OAEP padding with a real SSH key"](https://github.com/Ranlot/public-key-encryption/blob/master/RSA-paper.pdf)  
Deep dive into the mathematics of RSA algorithm, its homomorphic properties and the OAEP randomized padding.
